    <p>
      I’m a Master’s student in Robotics with a focus on control systems,
      reinforcement learning, and humanoid robotics. My work sits at the
      intersection of simulation, learning-based control, and real-world
      deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have hands-on experience building and training locomotion and
      manipulation policies in simulation, particularly using NVIDIA Isaac
      Lab and modern RL frameworks. I’ve worked extensively with velocity
      tracking, stand-up behaviors, curriculum learning, and manager-based
      RL environments for legged and humanoid robots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond research, I have industry experience in manufacturing and
      automation, including virtual commissioning, industrial simulation,
      and control systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interests include humanoid locomotion, robot learning,
      simulation-to-real transfer, and building robust, field-ready robotic systems.
