  <h1>Isaac Legene</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a Master’s student in Robotics with a focus on control systems,
    reinforcement learning, and humanoid robotics. My work sits at the
    intersection of simulation, learning-based control, and real-world
    deployment.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have hands-on experience building and training locomotion and
    manipulation policies in simulation, particularly using NVIDIA Isaac
    Lab and modern RL frameworks. I’ve worked extensively with velocity
    tracking, stand-up behaviors, curriculum learning, and manager-based
    RL environments for legged and humanoid robots.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond research, I have industry experience in manufacturing and
    automation, including virtual commissioning, industrial simulation,
    and control systems. I’m comfortable working across the stack —
    from low-level C++ and Python robotics code to higher-level system
    design and experimentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests include humanoid locomotion, robot learning, simulation-to-real
    transfer, and building robust, field-ready robotic systems.
